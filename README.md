# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page AJAX-based Twitter clone that uses jQuery, HTML5 and CSS within it. You can create your own tweeter posts and the server will assign a random user name and handler name to you. The time of the post from the current date will also be shown within the post. 

The clone is a responsive design with three different appearances based on the width of a device and has error handling for standard errors.
